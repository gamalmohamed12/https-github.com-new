## Project Overview

This project uses data-driven analysis to explore:
- **AI Adoption and Automation Risk**: Examines the likelihood of automation across job roles and the level of AI integration.
- **Required Skills and Changing Demand**: Identifies critical skills that are most in demand as AI becomes more prevalent, focusing on skills that are less likely to be automated.
- **Employment Projections**: Analyzes job growth and decline across industries impacted by AI advancements.

The analysis is intended to help businesses, policymakers, and job seekers understand and respond to the ways AI is transforming the job market.

## Key Findings

Through data visualization and storytelling, this project highlights how AI:
- Creates new opportunities in fields requiring advanced technical skills.
- Poses challenges for jobs that involve routine tasks, which are more susceptible to automation.
- Shifts demand toward hybrid skills that combine technical proficiency and creative or social capabilities.

These insights are essential for preparing the workforce with relevant skills and making informed decisions about talent development and resource allocation.

## Tools and Methodology

This project leverages:
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- **SQL**: To manage and query datasets for meaningful insights.
- **Excel**: For organizing data, performing calculations, and building initial analyses.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards to visualize the impact of AI on different job roles and industries.

## Overview of the Data

This project uses the **"From Data Entry to CEO: The AI Job Threat Index"** dataset, originally uploaded by TENSOR BOY on Kaggle under the CC0 Public Domain license. This dataset aggregates insights from various AI and job analytics platforms, offering a broad view of AI’s influence on different job roles.

### Key Features

- **Job Titles**: Lists job roles across industries.
- **AI Impact**: Percentage that indicates AI's influence on each role.
- **Tasks**: Number of tasks done by humans for each job title.
- **AI Models**: Count of AI models integrated into each job’s workflow.
- **AI Workload Ratio**: Represents the balance of work done by AI vs. humans.
- **Domain**: The industry or field each job belongs to.

This data provides a comprehensive analysis of how AI reshapes the job landscape, focusing on automation trends, skill demands, and industry-specific insights.
